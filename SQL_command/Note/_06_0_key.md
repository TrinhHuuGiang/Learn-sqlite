## Primary key
- A `primary key` is applied to one column or a group of columns in a table. It is used to uniquely identify each row in the table.
- Characteristic:
    - A primary key enforces both the `UNIQUE` and `NOT NULL` constraints.
    - It can be defined on a `single column` or a combination of `multiple columns`.
    - `Each table` can have only `one primary key`.
    - A primary key automatically `creates` an `index`, which `improves` data lookup `performance`.
- Create a primary key in `sqlite3`:
    - Primary key only add on table when `CREATE TABLE`
    - If we want add new primary key on exist table we can't use `ALTER`
        - Instead we will:
            - `Create new table` with collumn have primary key as you want
            - Using `INSERT` compose with `SELECT` to fill new table with data of `old table` want change primary key
                - Example:
                ``` sql
                INSERT INTO new_table SELECT * FROM old_table
                ```
            - Then delete `old table` and using `ALTER` to change the name of `new table`.
            - Done.
- Syntax add primary key:
    - Add primary key at last line of `CREATE TABLE` command.
    - Syntax: `PRIMARY KEY (column_a, column_b,...)`

## Foreign key
- A `foreign key` using refer to an exist `primary key` so we have to has a `primary key`
- A table can have more than 1 `foreign key`
- **Note**:
    - `foreign key` always delete before `primary key`
    - `primary key` can't delete if a `foreign key` point to it
    - 1 `foreign key` only match with 1 `primary key`
- Syntax:
    - As `primary key` , we have to add `foreign key` when `CREATE TABLE`
    - Syntax create `foreign key` for `1 primary key` or `composite primary key`:
        ```sql
        FOREIGN KEY ([col1], [col2]) REFERENCES primary_key_table_name([primary_key_col1], [primary_key_col2])
        ```
